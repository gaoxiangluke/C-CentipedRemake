# C-CentipedRemake
This is the first major programming project I have done in my life. This project was the group project for introduction to Computer Science 2016. 
# Overview
This a Atari Centiped remake (with a starwars theme) made with C++ and sdl.
I added some interesting feature such as cheat code to make the game a little bit more fun.
